# Virtual Bartender 

I wanted to create a simulation of the bartender's choice online. Users select their preferences for a cocktail, and they are given a cocktail that matches that criteria.  Users choose their preferences for a liquor base, cocktail type and a fruit. I'm using the database from CocktailDB() for drink information.
